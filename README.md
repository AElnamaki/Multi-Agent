## Overview

The **MiniAI Multi-Agent System** is a modular AI framework designed to process complex goals through coordinated multi-agent workflows. It leverages specialized agents for research, reasoning, planning, execution, and evaluationâ€”working together to achieve robust task completion.

---

## Features

* **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for research, reasoning, planning, execution, and evaluation.
* **LLM Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) with retry logic and failover mechanisms.
* **Memory System**: Hybrid memory architecture combining a vector database (ChromaDB) with a key-value store (Redis).
* **Benchmarking Suite**: Tools for comprehensive performance evaluation.
* **Structured Logging**: JSON-based logs for improved monitoring and analysis.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Redis
* ChromaDB
* OpenAI API key *(optional)*
* Anthropic API key *(optional)*
